Incredibly simple email layout customization for all transaccional email sent by Wordpress.

== Description ==

This is the first in a series of plugins called "Incredibly Simple". After years of using WP, I'm tired of seeing very complex plugins that promise a relatively simple function but do nothing more than mess up the code, cluttering the admin with options.
These plugins are the opposite. A simple, concrete function and the least possible intervention in your theme and installation.
Is (Incredibly Simple) an Email Customization. That's all.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `is-a-email` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the logo on Settings > Logo Email Configuration

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin only allow to modify the logo in wordpress emails like "New User", "Change Password", etc? =
Yes, just that.

= Can I change the design if I want to? =
No, you can only upload the logo. The design is a simple email with a centered logo and the original text underneath. The minimum necessary.
